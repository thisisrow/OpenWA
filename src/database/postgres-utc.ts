/**
 * UTC pin for the PostgreSQL data connection.
 *
 * Every timestamp column on this connection is `timestamp without time zone`, which carries no zone at
 * all: a stored value means whatever the writer's convention was. Three writers touch those columns and
 * they did not agree.
 *
 *  - the driver binds a JS Date as the PROCESS's local wall time (`sessions.connectedAt`, the lease
 *    columns, the pending-delivery stamps: every column the app itself writes),
 *  - the driver parses a naive timestamp back as PROCESS-local,
 *  - `DEFAULT now()`, which is what fills every `@CreateDateColumn`/`@UpdateDateColumn` (TypeORM does
 *    not bind those), writes the SERVER session's zone.
 *
 * Off UTC the row therefore carries two conventions at once, and comparisons that mix them are wrong by
 * the offset: a retention `LessThan(cutoff)` binds the cutoff as local wall time and measures it against
 * `createdAt` written in the server's zone. The same split is what shifts a backup on restore, because
 * the archive's ISO text is bound as text and the server drops its zone.
 *
 * So the connection is pinned end to end: bind as UTC, parse as UTC, and hold the session on UTC.

 * offset in every retention window and every ordering, silently and permanently. The ways it can be
 * left half-applied are real (a pooler that drops session state, a server-side default re-applied after
 * the SET), so the effective setting is read back rather than assumed.
 *
 * The offset is what is checked, not the name: `UTC`, `Etc/UTC` and `GMT` are all correct, and a name
 * check would fail a deployment that is already right. It is sampled at TWO instants six months apart,
 * because a single reading of `now()` does not separate a fixed +00 zone from one that observes daylight
 * saving: `Europe/London`, `Europe/Lisbon` and `Atlantic/Canary` all sit at +00 from late October to late
 * March, so a winter boot would pass an unpinned session and every summer `now()` would then be written
 * an hour ahead of what the driver reads back, with no restart in between to notice. The pair is taken
 * relative to `now()` rather than at fixed calendar dates so it follows the zone's CURRENT rules.
